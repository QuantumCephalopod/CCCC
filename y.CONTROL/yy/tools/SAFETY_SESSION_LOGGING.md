# Session Logging Safety Analysis

This note responds to the question of how to make the `w4k3` and `sl33p` logging tools safe for Codex agents. Previous sessions hesitated to execute these utilities because they might violate the policy against running untrusted code. After reviewing the scripts, we find they only perform local file and git operations using the Python standard library. No network access or dynamic code execution is present.

## Current Constraints
- Agents avoid code that invokes external programs or unknown libraries.
- All actions must remain within the repository directory.
- Interactive prompts can lead to unintended commits if aborted midway.

## Safe Operations
Reading JSON files and writing new ones are safe because the operations involve deterministic file I/O. The same applies to running `git` commands that only affect the repository.

## Suggested Improvements
1. **Non-interactive mode**: Allow setting environment variables (`ASSESS`, `ACHIEVE`, `NEXT`) so the script can run without user prompts. This ensures the session can be logged programmatically.
2. **Dry-run flag**: Implement an option like `--dry-run` to preview the record without committing, preventing accidental data entry during testing.
3. **Input validation**: Strip control characters from answers before saving to avoid entries like `^C`.
4. **Explicit confirmation**: Ask for a final yes/no confirmation before writing the file and committing.

## Implemented Improvements
- `sl33p` now accepts the `ASSESS`, `ACHIEVE`, and `NEXT` environment variables. If they are set, the tool skips user prompts.
- A `--dry-run` flag (or `SL33P_DRY_RUN=1`) prints the JSON that would be saved without writing or committing.
- All input values pass through a sanitizer that removes control characters.

These adjustments keep the workflow within safety parameters while maintaining research continuity.
