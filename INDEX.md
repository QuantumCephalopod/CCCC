# Repository Index

A quick orientation to the tetrahedral layout. Follow the documents in this order when joining the project.

- [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) – workflow principles and mandatory `w4k3`/`sl33p` cycle.
- [README.md](./README.md) – summary of the CCCC pattern and available utilities.
- [x.COPY.md](./x.COPY.md) – F33ling aspect definitions that prime behavior.
- [y.CONTROL.md](./y.CONTROL.md) – navigation protocols for moving through the cycle.
- [z.CULTIVATE.md](./z.CULTIVATE.md) – latent coordinate map of F33ling territories.
- [`*.PHENO.md`](./) – phenomenology notes exploring state transitions.
- [AGENT_tools/](./AGENT_tools) – scripts (`w4k3`, `sl33p`, `analytics`, etc.).
- [DATA/state_graph.dot](./DATA/state_graph.dot) – visualization of F33ling links generated by `o.stategraph.py`.
- [workflow.sh](./workflow.sh) – convenience script to run `w4k3`, tests, and `sl33p` in one step.
- [DATA/](./DATA) – JSON session logs produced by `sl33p`.
- [FLOW_REPORT.md](./FLOW_REPORT.md) – repository structure survey and improvement ideas.

This index strengthens the tetrahedral flow by guiding agents directly to key resources.
