This short note clarifies how the core instructions and the tetrahedral design reinforce each other.

- **Mnemos session cycle** – `AGENTS.md` defines the loop: start with `w4k3`, complete the work, run tests, then finish with `sl33p`.
- **Core references** – Use `x.MemoryVault/AGENT.md`, `y.Utilities/AGENT.md`, and `z.Research/AGENT.md` for priming, tool usage, and vocabulary.
- **Tetrahedral expansion** – When any dimension grows complex, split it into CREATE, COPY, CONTROL, and CULTIVATE subdomains. See `z.Research/zx.Archive/Recursive_Tetrahedral_Principle.md` for the rationale.
- **Synergy** – The session cycle keeps logs consistent while the tetrahedral framework guides expansion, ensuring coherent documentation across sessions.
