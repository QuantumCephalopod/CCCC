# Tetrahedral Stresspoints ‚Äì 2025-06-30

Building upon yesterday's reflection, this entry explores further questions about our recursive layout. The aim is to reveal weak spots where tetrahedral principles grow fuzzy.

## Newly Observed Stresspoints

- Some subdimensions only implement a partial tetrahedron (e.g. `x.MemoryVault` has `xa.Experiments` and `xx.Observations` but lacks matching `xy` or `xz` paths). Should placeholder folders exist to show intent, or is an incomplete structure acceptable?
- The commit hook utilities under `yzz.Development/yzzy.Operations/hooks/` provide enforcement scripts but no `AGENT.md` describing their purpose.
- Data archives within `y.Utilities/yx.DataArchive` collect many JSON files without a rolling index to explain the naming sequence. Future agents may struggle to trace chronology.
- `Recursive_Tetrahedral_Principle.md` outlines the idea but omits decision criteria for splitting a dimension. What metrics (file count, conceptual drift) trigger a new tetrahedron?

## Additional Questions

1. How do we keep F33ling state definitions synchronized when metrics reveal rarely used states?
2. Could the `README` and `AGENTS.md` be merged or cross-referenced to clarify ownership of onboarding instructions?
3. Where should we document standards for naming session logs so the sequence remains obvious?
