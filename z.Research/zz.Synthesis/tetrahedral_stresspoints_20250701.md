# Tetrahedral Stresspoints ‚Äì 2025-07-01

A brief continuation of the ongoing survey. Today the lack of guidance
inside `y.Utilities/yz.AgentOps/yzz.Development/yzzy.Operations/hooks/`
was patched by adding an `AGENT.md`. This clarifies that the commit
hook scripts enforce commit-template consistency.

## Remaining Questions

- How should subdimensions surface new guidance once the stresspoint is
  resolved? Should `INDEX.md` record the fix or maintain a historical
  note?
- Could automated checks remind agents to install the hook after
  cloning?

### Resolution

Until automated reminders exist, the `INDEX.md` should briefly note
when a stresspoint is fixed and link to the relevant documentation.
This keeps historical context while guiding agents to the new
location. Commit hook installation tips now appear in `README.md` and
`yzz.Development/yzzy.Operations/hooks/AGENT.md`.
