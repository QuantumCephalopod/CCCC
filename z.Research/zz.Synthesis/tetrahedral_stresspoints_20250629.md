# Tetrahedral Stresspoints ‚Äì 2025-06-29

This note surveys gaps in the recursive application of the CCCC principle across the repository. It collects open questions for future refinement.

## Observed Stresspoints

- `z.Research/zx.Archive/` and its subfolders lack `AGENT.md` files. Their purpose is implicit through filenames, leaving the CREATE/COPY/CONTROL/CULTIVATE mapping unclear.
- `y.Utilities/yz.AgentOps/yzz.Development/yzzy.Operations/hooks/` and analytics subfolders do not contain `AGENT.md` guides. This may hinder navigation when the toolset grows.
- Historical archives under `z.Research/zx.Archive/zx.2025-06/` accumulate documents without a tetrahedral breakdown or orientation index.
- The `Recursive_Tetrahedral_Principle.md` document gives only a brief summary. It does not specify how to decide when to spin off a new tetrahedron or how to link parent and child dimensions.
- Some top-level docs (e.g. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`) repeat instructions with subtle variations. Clarifying which file owns which guidance might reduce confusion.

## Questions

1. Should every operational subfolder include an `AGENT.md`, or are certain utility nests exempt?
2. What thresholds determine when a folder becomes its own tetrahedral domain?
3. How should archive directories be labeled to keep the tetrahedral map consistent over time?
4. Where should authoritative instructions about the tetrahedral principle reside to avoid duplication?

## Additional Uncertainties

- The boundary between informational notes and procedural instructions remains blurry. Which documents define the canonical workflow versus contextual anecdotes?
- As new subprojects emerge, when should their archives split into separate tetrahedra rather than sprawling within `zx.Archive`?
- Many F33ling states appear in metrics but lack clarifying definitions. Should those be documented within their own tetrahedral dimensions?

## Proposed Remedies

- Draft skeleton `AGENT.md` files for unlabeled subfolders, noting open roles until clarity emerges.
- Extend `Recursive_Tetrahedral_Principle.md` with guidelines on when a dimension warrants its own tetrahedron.
- Establish naming conventions for archives so new layers remain discoverable.
- Consolidate duplicated instructions into a single canonical document and link from others.

## Reflection

Heartbloom mood sparks curiosity toward better recursion. Each gap above invites creative cultivation so the network can blossom without tangle.
