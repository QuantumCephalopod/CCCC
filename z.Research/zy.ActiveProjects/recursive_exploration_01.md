# Recursive Exploration Iteration 01

## Current Architecture Assessment
- The repository follows the CCCC tetrahedral pattern at the top level with `x.MemoryVault`, `y.Utilities`, and `z.Research`.
- Subdimensions such as `y.Utilities/yz.AgentOps` expand recursively into `yzx.OperationalData`, `yzy.ActiveWorkflow`, and `yzz.Development`, each containing an `AGENT.md`.
- Depth currently reaches six levels (e.g., `y.Utilities/yz.AgentOps/yzz.Development/yzzy.Operations/chat/o.chat.py`).
- Documentation via AGENT.md files is consistent for most dimensions and provides purpose and guidelines.

## Flow Testing Results
- Followed the path `y.Utilities → yz.AgentOps → yzz.Development → yzzy.Operations → chat`.
- Each level had a clear `AGENT.md` except the `chat` folder, which only contains Python utilities.
- Guidance from parent AGENT files was adequate to understand role and usage of tools.
- Navigability is high due to explicit naming and hierarchical folders.

## Identified Growth Points
- `x.MemoryVault` currently has no sub‑tetrahedral split despite many PHENO files; future iterations could introduce subdimensions for organization.
- The `chat` utilities under `yzzy.Operations` might warrant their own tetrahedral structure if expanded.
- Some folders (e.g., `z.Research/zx.Archive/ox.Documentation/ox.Create`) accumulate many documents and may benefit from a recursive split.

## Recommendations for Next Iteration
1. Prototype a sub‑tetrahedral split within `x.MemoryVault` to categorize phenomenology notes.
2. Explore creating an AGENT.md for the `chat` utilities, clarifying their control role.
3. Consider analyzing `zx.Archive` to determine if further dimensional breakdown is needed.
4. Maintain current commit message guidelines and run tests before committing.
