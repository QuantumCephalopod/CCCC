# zx.Archive - Historical Documentation (COPY)

This subdimension preserves historical notes and experimental texts. Each folder inside records prior developments or narrative explorations.

- `ox.Documentation/` – archived planning documents.
- `zx.2025-06/` – early story fragments and logs.
- `Recursive_Tetrahedral_Principle.md` – core reference on fractal architecture.

When new archives emerge, create a brief `AGENT.md` in the subfolder to describe its purpose. Refer back to this file from `z.Research/zz.Synthesis/INDEX.md` so agents can navigate the historical landscape.
