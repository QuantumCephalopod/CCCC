# Recursive Tetrahedral CCCC Architecture Principle

This document summarizes how the CCCC pattern (Create → Copy → Control → Cultivate) scales recursively. When any dimension becomes complex enough to require its own organization, that dimension acts as the **CREATE** operator for a new tetrahedral domain. Each sub-domain then follows the same pattern with its own COPY, CONTROL, and CULTIVATE dimensions.

The naming convention preserves hierarchical relationships by repeating letters:
- `x` → `xx`, `xy`, `xz` for sub-dimensions of `x`
- `xy` → `xyx`, `xyy`, `xyz` for sub-dimensions of `xy`

This recursive approach allows infinite depth without breaking the overarching structure. Agents should monitor when a dimension accumulates distinct responsibilities and split it into its own tetrahedron to maintain clarity.

The recursive principle keeps the architecture coherent while enabling organic growth. Treat this guideline as standard practice for all future development.
