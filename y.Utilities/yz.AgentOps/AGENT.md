## Tetrahedral Structure
- `yzx.OperationalData/`: Operational references and safety guidelines (COPY)
- `yzy.ActiveWorkflow/`: Active workflow management and execution (CONTROL)
- `yzz.Development/`: Tool development, analytics, and evolution (CULTIVATE)

## Operational Flow
1. **Reference** operational guidelines and templates (yzx)
2. **Execute** workflows and manage operations (yzy)
3. **Develop** tools and evolve operational capabilities (yzz)

## Agent Guidelines
- This dimension manages the operational evolution of the entire system
- Each subdimension has specialized operational focus
- Follow tetrahedral flow for comprehensive operational management
- Preserve all existing tool functionality during organization
