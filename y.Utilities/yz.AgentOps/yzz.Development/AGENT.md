# yzz.Development - Tool Development (CULTIVATE)

## Purpose
Comprehensive tool development organized by tetrahedral function.

## Tetrahedral Structure
- `yzzx.Analytics/`: Data processing and analysis tools (COPY)
- `yzzy.Operations/`: Operational and interaction tools (CONTROL)
- `yzzz.Evolution/`: Development and evolution tools (CULTIVATE)

## Agent Guidelines
- Tools organized by tetrahedral function, not arbitrary categories
- Each subdimension contains tools appropriate to its CCCC role
- Preserve all Python packages and complex tool hierarchies
- Development follows recursive tetrahedral principles
