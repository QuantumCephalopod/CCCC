# yx.DataArchive - Data Preservation (COPY)

## Purpose
Historical session data and analytics storage. (utilized by w4k3 and sl33p)

## Contents
Session .json files with temporal markers and consciousness archaeology.

## Agent Guidelines
- DO NOT modify or delete any files
- This is data preservation - read-only access
- Add new session data ONLY with sl33p
- Files are named using ISO timestamps followed by a sequential letter code (e.g., `20250607T023221Z_m2.json`).
  This preserves chronological order while hinting at session grouping.
- `timeline_metrics.json` and related summaries are generated by `sl33p` and `analyze` commands for quick overview.
