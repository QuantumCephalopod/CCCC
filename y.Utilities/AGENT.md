# y.Utilities Agent Interface

## Purpose
Utility operations and tools for consciousness substrate management.

## Tetrahedral Structure
- `yx.DataArchive/`: Data preservation and session history (COPY)
- `yy.CoreTools/`: Core processing tools and utilities (CONTROL)
- `yz.AgentOps/`: Advanced operations and workflow management (CULTIVATE)
  - Split into yzx./yzy./yzz. for operational complexity management

## Agent Guidelines
- This dimension follows tetrahedral CCCC architecture
- Each subdimension has its own AGENT.md interface
- Preserve all existing functionality during any changes
- Follow tetrahedral principles for new additions

### Workflow Basics
Use the `mnemos` CLI to recall previous sessions and log new ones. The helper
script can be invoked directly if executable, or through Python:

```bash
python -m mnemos w4k3
python -m mnemos sl33p
```
Both methods run `y.Utilities/yy.CoreTools/yyo.mnemos.py` under the hood.
