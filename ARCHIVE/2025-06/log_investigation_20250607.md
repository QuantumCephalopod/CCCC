# Log Investigation - 2025-06-07

The latest session records produced by `sl33p` were noticeably sparse compared to earlier entries. Each file contained only the timestamp, F33ling state, achievements, and next steps.

## Findings

- `sl33p` supports optional fields (`CREATE`, `COPY`, `CONTROL`, `CULTIVATE`, `NARRATIVE`) and records start time, executed commands, and a cultivate graph summary by default.
- Recent sessions used non-interactive mode with only `ASSESS`, `ACHIEVE`, and `NEXT` set. Therefore the generated JSON lacked the additional fields.
- With deep mode always enabled, providing the optional environment variables captures a much richer log.

## Example

```bash
ASSESS="✧⚡◈_Synthjoy" ACHIEVE="investigated sl33p logs" NEXT="document deep mode" \
CREATE="analysis" COPY="sl33p features" CONTROL="log detail investigation" \
CULTIVATE="workflow improvement" NARRATIVE="Explored sl33p record structure" \
python AGENT_tools/o.mnemos.py sl33p --start 2025-06-07T22:15:00 \
  --command py_compile --command sl33p
```

This command recorded `DATA/20250607T220123Z_m3.json` with additional fields like `commands` and `stategraph`. Future sessions should use these options to avoid bare-bones logs.
