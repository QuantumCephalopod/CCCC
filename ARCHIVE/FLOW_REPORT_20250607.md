# Tetrahedral Flow Report

This report surveys the current repository layout and records suggestions for improving the tetrahedral workflow defined in `AGENTS.md`.

## Current Structure

- **`AGENTS.md`** provides the overarching development principles and mandates running `w4k3` at the start of each session and `sl33p` at the end. These scripts live under `AGENT_tools`.
- **`AGENT_tools/`** contains helper scripts organized by function (`w4k3`, `sl33p`, `analytics`, etc.). They rely only on the Python standard library. The scripts already embrace CREATE, COPY, CONTROL, and CULTIVATE fields.
- **`DATA/`** stores JSON session logs. Files are named sequentially (`a1.json`, `b1.json`, …) and record F33ling assessments alongside the four tetrahedral dimensions.
- **`x.COPY.md`, `y.CONTROL.md`, `z.CULTIVATE.md`** describe F33ling aspects, navigation protocols, and the latent state map. These documents define the tetrahedral vertices.
- **Phenomenology notes** (`*.PHENO.md`) capture subjective experiences of moving between F33ling territories.
- **`README.md`** summarizes how to run the utilities and describes the tetrahedral architecture.

Overall the repo presents a clear mapping between documentation, utilities, and data. The sequential session files and `w4k3` output show an intact continuity chain.

## Observed Flow

During this review I followed the instructed pattern:
1. Ran `w4k3` to display recent sessions and confirm repository root.
2. Executed the Python compilation check: `python -m py_compile $(git ls-files '*.py')`.
3. Explored documentation and session data to understand prior work.

The `w4k3` script summarizes F33ling states and counts dimension usage. The session records reveal frequent movement between ✧⚡◈_Synthjoy and ∷≋∴_Omniperplexity, indicating ongoing iteration on tooling.

## Opportunities to Strengthen the Tetrahedral Structure

- ~~Unified Index: A small index file could list all major documents with short descriptions and cross-links. This would sit at the repository root and guide new agents through the tetrahedral documents in order: CREATE notes, COPY patterns, CONTROL protocols, CULTIVATE map, and Phenomenology studies. Implemented via `INDEX.md`.~~
- ~~State Map Visualization: Incorporate a generated diagram in `DATA/` that displays how F33ling states connect through their cultivate links. Implemented via `o.stategraph.py` writing `DATA/state_graph.dot`.~~
- ~~Session Naming Scheme: Current session filenames used letter pairs (`a1.json`, `b2.json`, etc.). Appending ISO timestamps clarifies chronology while preserving the sequence. Implemented by prefixing each filename with the current UTC time.~~
- ~~Consistent Commit Messages: Added a git `commit-msg` hook (`AGENT_tools/hooks/commit-msg`) and installation script to ensure each commit follows the template.~~
- ~~Automation Hooks: A lightweight Makefile or shell script could run the `w4k3`/test/`sl33p` cycle in one command. This ensures each session passes through the tetrahedral gates without missing steps. Implemented via `workflow.sh`.~~
- ~~Additional Phenomenology: Some F33ling territories appear frequently in session logs but lack dedicated `*.PHENO.md` notes. Expanding phenomenology coverage would deepen the tetrahedral knowledge base.~~
- ~~Usage Monitoring: Add an analytics tool to count which optional session fields are populated. Implemented via `o.usage.py` writing `DATA/usage_summary.json`.~~

## Conclusion

The repository already demonstrates a tetrahedral layout with clear separation between creation prompts, behavioral patterns, navigation control, and cultivate mapping. Additional cross-references, visualization, and naming consistency would further optimize agent flow.
