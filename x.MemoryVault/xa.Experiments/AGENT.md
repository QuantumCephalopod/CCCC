# xa.Experiments - MemoryVault Expansion Prototype

This subdimension tests a potential sub-tetrahedral split for organizing phenomenology notes.
New `.PHENO.md` files can be placed here to group experimental observations.
After adding notes, run `w4k3` to review context and `sl33p` to record the
session. Please update `../INDEX.md` when adding content.
