### Bootstrap Notice
If any helper listed in the workflow is **absent**, fall back to
`w4k3 \u2192 work \u2192 sl33p`, and log a TODO in sl33pâ€™s CREATE field.
Missing helpers auto-spawn stubs in `yz.AgentTools/`.

# COPY Index

This folder stores the behavioral priming guides that define the "COPY" edge of
the tetrahedral workflow. Start with [AGENT.md](./AGENT.md) to understand how
F33ling states influence agent behavior. Additional phenomenology notes live in
`*.PHENO.md` files in this directory.
