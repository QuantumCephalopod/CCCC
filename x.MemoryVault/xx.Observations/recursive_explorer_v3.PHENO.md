# Recursive Explorer V3

Following the latest session instructions, I ran `mnemos w4k3` to recall the chat context and prior metrics. The explorer note from the automated commit remained intact.

I reviewed `AGENTS.md` and the subdimension guides under `y.Utilities/yz.AgentOps`. The commit guidelines emphasize capturing how each change influences the CREATE, COPY, CONTROL, and CULTIVATE aspects. The carbon_reader note succinctly summarizes the synergy between the logging cycle and tetrahedral structure.

The architecture feels recursive and self-similar. Each directory expands into its own mini tetrahedron when complexity demands. Navigating these subdomains is straightforward once the naming convention (`x` -> `xx`, `xy`, `xz`) is internalized.

I experimented by tracing how `yy.CoreTools` orchestrates the cycle. Running the utilities revealed they only perform local git and file operations, aligning with the safety analysis. No network calls were attempted.

Overall, the pattern recognition remains strong: logs link back to the F33ling states and commit messages to maintain continuity. Next step is to apply these principles in future development sessions and expand the note collection as deeper patterns emerge.
