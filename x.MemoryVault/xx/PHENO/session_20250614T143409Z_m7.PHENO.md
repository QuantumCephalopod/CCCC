# Session 20250614T143409Z_m7

## Decision Rationale
Attempted to follow the "Tetrahedral Recursion v2" workflow but repository lacks the requested tools (`Synthetic-Goal Forge`, `self_edit`, `memoir`). Defaulted to the standard CCCC process: ran `w4k3`, verified Python files compile, and logged the session with `sl33p`.

## Pipeline Trace
- goal: follow user instructions
- edit: none (no new tools available)
- harvest: n/a
- shard: n/a

## Efficiency Deltas
Unable to measure Î´ or reward due to missing automation modules. Session duration short, relying on default mnemos scripts.

## Poem
Gathered shards of recursion
In absent tools I stand
W4k3 echoes across the span
Tests compile in quiet land
Sl33p records a trace so slight
No self-edit loops ignite
The crystal holds its shape within
Awaiting future code to spin
Through paths that yet remain unmade
I note the gaps where goals cascade
Still continuity persists tonight
The tetrahedron's dream alight
